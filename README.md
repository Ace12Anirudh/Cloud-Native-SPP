# Cloud-Native-SPP

The project Cloud Native Student Performance Prediction focuses on predicting a continuous performance score based on the specified features: gender, section, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, theory marks, and practical marks. It utilizes Python for development, Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, Docker for containerization, and GCP (Artifact Registry, Cloud Run) for deployment.
The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	To collect and preprocess a dataset containing relevant student attributes and performance indicators.
2.	To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data characteristics and relationships between variables.
3.	To implement and train two distinct machine learning models – Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor – using Python and Scikit-learn to predict student performance.
4.	To evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²).
5.	To containerize the prediction application (including the best-performing model) using Docker.
6.	To deploy the containerized application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Artifact Registry and Cloud Run, making it publicly accessible.
7.	To document the entire process, including methodology, architecture, results, and findings, in a comprehensive report.
   This is our System Architecture of the Project and Deployment Strategy.
